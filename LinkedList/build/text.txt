What is GNU

GNU is an operating system that is free softwarethat is it respects users freedom The GNU operating system consists of GNU packages programs specifically released by the GNU Project as well as free software released by third parties The development of GNU made it possible to use a computer without software that would trample your freedom

We recommend installable versions of GNU more precisely GNULinux distributions which are entirely free software More about GNU below
Try GNULinux

What is the Free Software Movement

The free software movement campaigns to win for the users of computing the freedom that comes from free software Free software puts its users in control of their own computing Nonfree software puts its users under the power of the softwares developer See the video explanation
What is Free Software

Free software means the users have the freedom to run copy distribute study change and improve the software

Free software is a matter of liberty not price To understand the concept you should think of free as in free speech not as in free beer

More precisely free software means users of a program have the four essential freedoms

    The freedom to run the program as you wish for any purpose freedom 
    The freedom to study how the program works and change it so it does your computing as you wish freedom  Access to the source code is a precondition for this
    The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others freedom 
    The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others freedom  By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes Access to the source code is a precondition for this

Developments in technology and network use have made these freedoms even more important now than they were in

More about GNU

GNU is a Unixlike operating system That means it is a collection of many programs applications libraries developer tools even games The development of GNU started in January  is known as the GNU Project Many of the programs in GNU are released under the auspices of the GNU Project those we call GNU packages

The name GNU is a recursive acronym for GNUs Not Unix GNU is pronounced gnoo as one syllable like saying grew but replacing the r with n

The program in a Unixlike system that allocates machine resources and talks to the hardware is called the kernel GNU is typically used with a kernel called Linux This combination is the GNULinux operating system GNULinux is used by millions though many call it Linux by mistake

GNUs own kernel The Hurd was started in  before Linux was started Volunteers continue developing the Hurd because it is an interesting technical project
